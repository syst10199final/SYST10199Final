                <h2 id="new-employee">How to create a new employee</h2>
                <p>Once you have logged in, you will be prompted with the manager home screen like so:
                <img src="../resources/images/help/homescreen.png" draggable=false>
                Next you will want to click on the "Manage Current Employees" Link. And will be redirected to a new page: <br>
                <img src="../resources/images/help/manage-employees.png" draggable=false>
                At the bottom you will see "Action Add New" already selected, then just fill out the Employee's name and Email address like so and click the "Save" button
                <img src="../resources/images/help/filling-out-name.png" draggable=false>
                From there you will be able to see the employee has been added to the database.
                <img src="../resources/images/help/name-appeared.png" draggable=false>
                </p>
            </section>
            
            
            <section>
                <h2 id="edit-employee">How to edit an employee</h2>
                <p>
                    Once again you will need to navigate to the "Manage Employees" page in order to start
                <img src="../resources/images/help/employees-updated-screen.png" draggable=false>
                This time we will need to click on the menu that is currently labeled "Add New" and select edit from there. And will be greeted with a different layout.
                <img src="../resources/images/help/edit-employee.png" draggable=false>
                Let's say Nancy chaned her email or we got her name wrong, we can change the email and name in the boxes labeled "Email" and "Name" respectively then click "Save"
                <img src="../resources/images/help/update-employee.png" draggable=false>
                Then as you can see, the name and or email has updated to the new information
                <img src="../resources/images/help/employee-updated.png" draggable=false>
                </p>
            </section>
            
            <section>
            <h2 id="delete-employee">How to delete an employee</h2>
            <p>
                Now lets say Nancy has retired and needs to be taken off the schedule, firstly we need to navigate to the "Manage Employees" page
              <img src="../resources/images/help/employee-updated.png" draggable=false>
                Next we will click on the "Add New" box and select "Delete" and the box will change to another layout
            <img src="../resources/images/help/delete-employee.png" draggable=false>
            Then if the employee listed in "Employee to Edit" is not correct then click on the box and select the right one. Then click save and the page will update and remove the employee
            <img src="../resources/images/help/manage-employees.png" draggable=false>
            </p>
            </section>
